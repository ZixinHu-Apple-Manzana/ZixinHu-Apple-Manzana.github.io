title: "Refined Bonded Terms in Coarse-Grained Models for Intrinsically Disordered Proteins Improve Backbone Conformations"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
permalink: /publication/paper2024
excerpt: "This paper is about the refined coarse-grained (CG) bonded potentials for disordered proteins. It achieves near-quantitative accuracy with secondary structure propensity estimated by NMR data, and captures the transient secondary structure of p53. <br><b>NOTE: This is challenging even in atomistic model!</b></br><img src='/images/bonded_terms.png'>"

excerpt: 'This paper is about the role of intirnsically disordered regions (IDRs) in coronin finetunes the oligomerization of coiled-coil domain. This trait is observed in yeast but not in murine. The conclusion is that the IDR can compliment the packing of coiled-coil domain, and this effect is strong due to the deficiency of coiled-coil domain in yeast. In murine, the coiled-coil domain adopts perfect packing pattern, which caused selection strength on the length of IDR evolutionally. The coarse-grained model adopts a hybrid strategy, which treats folded domain with Gō-like model and IDRs with adapted Kim-Hummer model. '

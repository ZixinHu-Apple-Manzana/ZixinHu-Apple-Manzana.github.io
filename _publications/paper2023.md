excerpt: "<img align='center' src='/images/coiled_coil.png'><br><br><img align='center' src='/images/coiled_coil_table.png'><br><br>This paper is about the role of intirnsically disordered regions (IDRs) in the oligomerization of coronin. This trait is observed in yeast but not in murine. The IDR can facilitate the packing of coiled-coil domain, and this effect is strong due to the deficiency of coiled-coil domain in yeast. In murine, the coiled-coil domain adopts perfect packing pattern, which caused selection strength on the length of IDR evolutionally. The coarse-grained model adopts a hybrid strategy, which treats folded domain with Gō-like model and IDRs with adapted Kim-Hummer model. <br><b>PS: a very interesting work if you believe in evolution! :)</b>"
